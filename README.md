# hello-world
My first repo. Yay, baby steps!

I am learning something new- React.js.
And Spanish.
And how to make home-made beer.
I love my husband, my phone, peanut butter ice-cream, Reddit, Thor and PewDiePie (in no particular order).
In my spare time, I watch and rewatch Sheldon Cooper trying to make the world a better place.
Politically I am in a no man's land. But I love listening to Trump-speak when done by Trevor Noah.

And I live in the land Down Under. I moved here for the cheeseburgers and the beaches, from India (some call it Bhaarat, for no apparent reason).
